KekBot is a friendly meme and community based bot! Designed completely from the ground up, this bot is constantly being updated with new features and being maintained to keep up with Discord's constant API changes. From memes, to admin tools, to fun minigames to kill time, KekBot is meant to be an all-in-one solution for any server. (Though it won't get jealous if you decide to add another bot.)

KekBot is also open-source, meaning that anyone interesting in coding their own bots (or trying to selfhost KekBot) can easily dig through the code, and see just how it ticks.

KekBot also has a patreon, which you can check out here: https://www.patreon.com/KekBot
